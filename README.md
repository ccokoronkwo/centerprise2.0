## About

Centerprise 2.0 is a web application developed in Python (leveraging Flask).  Currently it is the last step in a monthly invoice entry, dispersement and facility allocation process.  After invoices, expense reimbersements, cedit cars invoices, payroll expenses have been downloaded and updated, Centerprise 2.0 will allocate all the CBO expenses to the facilities (and some sister companies) based on different allocation formulas per expense by GL Codes (excludes Flat Fee Facilities).

```
cboadmin@dev-ubu-03:~$ mkdir src
```

3. Navigate to the source folder

```
cboadmin@dev-ubu-03:~$ cd src
cboadmin@dev-ubu-03:~/src$
```

4. Initialize source folder for git

```
cboadmin@dev-ubu-03:~/src$ git init
```

5. Pull down the repo from github.

```
cboadmin@dev-ubu-03:~/src$ git clone https://github.com/ccokoronkwo/centerprise2.0.git centerprise2.0
```

6. Navigate to the cloned repo folder.

```
cboadmin@dev-ubu-03:~/src$ cd centerprise2.0
```

7. Install/update the virtualenv tool, build and activate an environment for the application.

```
cboadmin@dev-ubu-03:~/src/centerprise2.0$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
cboadmin@dev-ubu-03:~/src/centerprise2.0$ sudo pip3 install virtualenv
cboadmin@dev-ubu-03:~/src/centerprise2.0$ virtualenv cp2env
cboadmin@dev-ubu-03:~/src/centerprise2.0$ source cp2env/bin/activate
(cp2env)cboadmin@dev-ubu-03:~/src/centerprise2.0$
```

8. Restore application packages.

```
(cp2env)cboadmin@dev-ubu-03:~/src/centerprise2.0$ sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

9. Start application.

## User Authentication

Centerprise 2.0 uses Flask-Security for authentication, access and user management.  Flask-Security has many native advanced authentication and user login management features - all of which can be controlled from the ./app.config.py file.  See [this article](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Security/configuration.html) for customization options.

Default templates for security pages (login/logout/reset_password,etc) can be found in the following folder:
```
--centerprise2.0/app/templates/security/
